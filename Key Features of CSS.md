Key Features of the Updated CSS

1. Flexbox for Layout
- The body uses flexbox to center content vertically and horizontally.
- The form and section elements are styled with flexbox for alignment and spacing.

2. Grid for Image Galleries
- The .image-gallery class uses a responsive grid layout to display images in a clean, organized manner.

3. Improved Readability:
- Added padding, margins, and borders to sections and forms for better spacing.
- Used contrasting colors for text and backgrounds to improve visibility.

4. Responsive Design:
- The grid-template-columns property in the .image-gallery ensures images adjust based on screen size.
- The max-width property prevents elements from stretching too wide on larger screens.
